# React Learning Playground

This repository documents my journey of learning React by building small, practical examples.
Instead of just watching tutorials, I focus on implementing each concept and committing it.

## How I'm using this repo
- Learning React through FrontendMasters courses
- One concept → one small example
- One example → one commit

## Goal
Build a strong, practical understanding of core React concepts by writing code consistently.

## Progress
- Implemented first custom React components without JSX using React.createElement.
- Migrated React setup from CDN-based scripts to Vite with ESLint and Prettier configuration.
- Switched from React.createElement to JSX syntax
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for JSX support
- Practiced component composition using reusable components
- Ran a local API server alongside Vite
- Used Vite proxy to avoid CORS issues
- Loaded backend-served assets in React components
