# React Learning Playground

This repository documents my journey of learning React by building small, practical examples.
Instead of just watching tutorials, I focus on implementing each concept and committing it.

## How I'm using this repo
- Learning React through FrontendMasters courses
- One concept → one small example
- One example → one commit

## Goal
Build a strong, practical understanding of core React concepts by writing code consistently.

## Progress
- Implemented first custom React components without JSX using React.createElement.
